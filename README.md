Terrain Generator
=======
Small Terrain Generator, side project, will become part of a bigger one.
Using the fantastic "rlutil" library.
Hopefully will be easy to modify once I add comments and remove all propriety windows commands like system("cls")
Feel free to try this garbage yourself, and if seeing 9 multi coloured digits appear on a screen gets you off, then you hit a literal goldmine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I guess the current version is something like 1.0, since the core functionality (the terrain generator itself) is 100% functional. Now its expansion time and then time to abandon the project again!
