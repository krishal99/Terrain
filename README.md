    Terrain Generator

=======

Small Terrain Generator, side project, will become part of a bigger one.
Using the fantastic "rlutil" library.
Hopefully will be easy to modify since I added some comments and removed all propriety windows commands like system("cls"), replaced with stuff from the rlutil library... also works on Linux now (tested on iBook G4 running Lubuntu 14.04).
Feel free to try this garbage yourself, and if seeing 9 multi coloured digits appear on a screen gets you off, then you hit a literal goldmine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

I guess the current version is something like 1.45b, since the core functionality (the terrain generator itself) is 100% functional. Now its expansion time and then time to abandon the project again! 


For now I think I'll start on further expanding the mob generator and improving the battle system... but first the mob generator has to be good, and have more variety.

After the battle system, I will start working on hard coded bosses and levelling up, possibly an inventory system.

This is more like a note to myself, but some sounds would be nice (a bwaah at a boss fight, something friendly in a village/ town etc). I'm assuming it'll have to be 8 bit but that has its own charm... damn I should really research this since I completely forgot about wanting to implement that.

19/01/2018 - The Terrain generator is fully complete, with a basic combat and mob generator system. Now, I'll work on adding better mobs, giving towns a purpose, and making an inventory system.
