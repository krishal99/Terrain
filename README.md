Terrain Generator
=======
Small Terrain Generator, side project, possibly part of a bigger one.
Using the fantastic "rlutil" library.
Hopefully will be easy to modify once I add comments and remove all propriety windows commands like system("cls")
Feel free to try this garbage yourself, and if seeing 9 multi coloured digits appear on a screen gets you off, then you hit a literal goldmine ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
